## Description

This is a matching game.  Click on a tile to reveal it.  Click on a second tile, that is not already face up.  If they match, they will remain face up, otherwise they will return facedown.

Once all tiles have been paired (8 matches), the game ends.

## Contributing

To create this game I researched others viewpoints.  I watched a video by Mike Wales. The shuffle function from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976, was contained in the starter code I was given.  Very little of that original code remains.  For the modal window, I consulted the MDN <dialog> page.
